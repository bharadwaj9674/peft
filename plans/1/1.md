# Cross-Modal Neural Network Performance Improvement Roadmap

A structured 7-day plan to optimize our cross-modal neural network architecture.

## Day 1: Profiling and Analysis

### Profile the current model
- [ ] Use PyTorch Profiler to identify computational bottlenecks
- [ ] Trace memory usage patterns to detect potential inefficiencies
- [ ] Measure inference time for each modality separately and combined

### Analyze training dynamics
- [ ] Review learning curves for signs of underfitting/overfitting
- [ ] Check gradient norms/magnitudes across different components
- [ ] Identify which modality pairs align well and which need improvement

### Baseline performance
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics (R@1, R@5, R@10, mAP) for all retrieval directions
- [ ] Create performance table to track improvements

## Day 2: PEFT Optimization

### Optimize LoRA implementation
- [ ] Adjust rank hyperparameter (currently 8) based on modality performance
- [ ] Try asymmetric ranks for different modalities (higher for underperforming ones)
- [ ] Experiment with targeted LoRA application (apply to more layers in underperforming modalities)

### Implement and test adapter variants
- [ ] Try Parallel Adapters for better gradient flow
- [ ] Implement bottleneck adapters with different reduction factors
- [ ] Compare performance/efficiency tradeoffs of different adapter configurations

### Implement model merging
- [ ] Test LoRA weight merging for more efficient inference
- [ ] Try SparseLoRA for higher parameter efficiency

## Day 3: Embedding Space Improvements

### Enhance projection layers
- [ ] Replace simple MLP projections with more sophisticated architectures
- [ ] Add layer normalization before projection to stabilize training
- [ ] Test deeper projection networks with residual connections

### Shared embedding space tuning
- [ ] Experiment with embedding dimensionality (currently 512)
- [ ] Implement modality-specific temperature scaling for better alignment
- [ ] Add regularization techniques for the embedding space (orthogonality constraints)

### Implement curriculum learning
- [ ] Start training with "easier" modality pairs before harder ones
- [ ] Gradually increase batch size and loss weight for difficult pairs
- [ ] Use modality masks for progressive training

## Day 4: Loss Function and Training Dynamics

### Improve contrastive loss
- [ ] Replace InfoNCE with supervised contrastive or triplet loss variants

- [ ] Test different float precision for different components
- [ ] Monitor numerical stability and adjust accordingly

### Optimize batch construction
- [ ] Implement importance sampling based on retrieval difficulty
- [ ] Create "balanced" batches with proportional representation of hard/easy examples
- [ ] Test larger batch sizes with gradient accumulation

## Day 5: Encoder Improvements

### Experiment with encoder freezing strategies
- [ ] Test selective unfreezing of upper layers
